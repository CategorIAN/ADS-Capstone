The data that I will be using is primarily found from the "GET venues search" function used in Foursquare. I will finding venues from various cities and primarily using the venue category information from each venue. 

I will also be finding latitude and longitude data from the geopy module for each city that I am interested in. This will be used to chart cities in a folium map.

The cities that I am interested in are larger cities in Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Iowa. I am particularly interested in counting the number venues that are in the categories "Country Dance Club", "Salsa Club", and "Dance Studio", since I really enjoy dancing, and I would always want to live in a city that values dancing.
