I will create a set of functions to take in a list of cities and a list of venue categories to see, for each city, the percentage of venues of each category relative to the venues of all of the categories looked at. Then, once the venue category percentages are calculated for each city, cluster the cities based on their compositions to see which cities are similar to each other. 

For example, someone could look at the number venues in the categories of "Baseball Stadium", "Football Stadium", "Theater", and "Dance Studio" for various cities. Using this data, the cities that have a high venue category percentage in "Baseball Stadium" and "Football Stadium" would be better for people more interested in sports to live in. Similarly, the cities that have a high venue category percentage in "Theater" and "Dance Studio" would be better for people more interested in the performing arts. Furthermore, I live in Bozeman, MT, and I like the general layout of Bozeman, so if I ever needed to move, I would like to move to a place that was similar to Bozeman. Thus, it would be better to move to a place that was in the same cluster as Bozeman than a place in a different cluster than Bozeman. 

Once the cities are categorized in a cluster, I will mark each of them on a map with a color corresponding to its cluster.
